# cs234

My solutions for stanford cs234 reinforcement learning, [winter 2020](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/CS234Win2020/index.html) version.

Original assignment code in commit titled [initial commit](https://github.com/jonsondag/cs234/commit/323e072ef95c9c62d21b150c9fc6bd5ec875e052).

Each hw directory includes python code, .tex source and generated latex .pdf for the assignment.

There's a fair amount of assignment template code in the repo and it may be easiest to see my work using these commit diffs:
